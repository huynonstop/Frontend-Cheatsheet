# The Waterfall Approach

![Waterfall–Approach–scheme–image](assets/Software%20development/WATERFALL@2x.png)

### The Positives

- **Easy to work, manage and control.** Both developers and managers follow a clear plan. Each phase has definite deliverables and terms. This makes the working process seamless, understandable and easily controlled. Moreover, each project under the Waterfall model has the same pattern, so the team doesn’t need additional training to get to work.
- **Accurate documentation.** The Waterfall approach requires taking accurate notes for every stage to create a solid document base. This helps better understand the code logic and improve the software in the future, even in case of staff turnover. Papers can provide details to shareholders if needed or can be applied to other projects as well.
- **The outcome is known.** The client knows from the very beginning the program functionality and what it will look like. Consequently, project cost and timeline are also known. Such certainty is always pleasant because you can plan the budget and the release dates in advance.
- **Easy-to-meet deadlines.** The risk of missing a deadline is minimal since the beginning and the end of every development stage are defined and should be kept. The approach demands strict discipline that is profitable for customers.

### The Negatives

- **No room for error.** The greatest disadvantage of Waterfall is the inability to change something if the stage is completed. The process is linear and rigid, so you can’t jump between stages. If there is a bug or an unexpected change in a completed part, you can’t just fix it and move on — the project has to restart, which is very difficult and expensive.
- **Initial information is not always accurate.** The requirements are identified and discussed at the beginning of a project, but it may be difficult for clients to correctly express them at once. They may not know what exactly they want. If clients realize their true needs as the project progresses, those needs cannot be taken into account without impacting the budget and the timeline.
- **The client doesn’t see working software until late.** The working application is delivered at the final stage of the project. The client doesn’t see the results at intermediate stages, so the project is not transparent.
- **Lack of communication.** The project is divided into separate stages performed by separate teams. They do their work exclusively and aren’t involved in other tasks. Lack of face-to-face communication and cooperation leads to misunderstanding and errors.
- **Final testing.** Thorough testing is carried out only at the end. If serious bugs are revealed, the whole project is doomed.

### When to Use the Waterfall Methodology

It is most suitable for simple projects in which customers have a clear vision of what result they want and will not change their mind during the development process.

# Agile 

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

  Ý tưởng là đặt trọng tâm vào con người và sự tương hỗ giữa những thành viên trong nhóm. Cơ bản là nếu dự án có những thành viên có năng lực, chịu làm việc cùng nhau thì sẽ mang đến thành công cho dự án. Nếu dự án của bạn có quy trình làm việc tốt, được hỗ trợ những công cụ tốt nhất nhưng những thành viên không “cùng nhìn về một hướng” thì khả năng dự án thất bại là rất lớn.

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

  dành thời gian đó để trao đổi để hiểu thêm về công việc phải làm. Mọi người đừng hiểu lầm là làm Agile là không viết tài liệu. Ý tưởng là chỉ viết những gì mà mọi người cần đọc.	

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

  cộng tác với khách hàng để hiểu được khách hàng muốn gì và cần gì để có thể tư vấn và điều chỉnh thay vì chỉ dựa vào những điều đã quy định trong hợp đồng.

- Responding to change over following a plan

  Sự thay đổi đó có thể là thay đổi về yêu cầu, thay đổi công nghệ, thay đổi nhân sự, thay đổi deadline, thay đổi phương thức làm việc, v.v mặc dù kế hoạch đã được định ra rõ ràng từ đầu. Agile không khuyến khích cho sự thay đổi nhưng khuyến khích chúng ta tập thích nghi với thay đổi.

# Agile Model

After launching, customers start using the product, and if any problems occur, the team reviews and addresses them.

### The Positives

- **Changes are welcome.** The approach is flexible to add and accommodate new features easily. This means that clients are able to change their mind and implement new ideas without impacting the project timeline or budget. Moreover, the product is always kept up-to-date, as the latest technologies can be added at any time.
- **Strong teamwork.** Agile implies face-to-face communication and interaction between all team members. They all are responsible for the final working product, not only for isolated parts of a project. Such an approach increases product quality and improves the working atmosphere.
- **Client participation.** A great difference between Agile vs. Waterfall software development is the chance for clients to provide their feedback during the development, see intermediary results and influence the end product. This inspires trust relationships between clients and contractors.
- **Higher quality.** Each spring finishes with testing that enhances the quality of a product greatly. Developers can reveal bugs earlier and fix them before the development cycle ends, which is much faster, easier and cost-efficient.

### The Negatives

Though Agile is mostly seen as a positive software development approach, it also has some cons. There are even a few advantages of the Waterfall model over Agile.

- **Lack of planning**. Because the initial plan is rough and additional sprints may be added across the development cycle, it is not always possible to determine the exact delivery date and complete tasks in a timely manner.
- **Neglected documentation.** The main goal of agile development is working software, and team members don’t focus on maintaining proper records. Lack of comprehensive documentation may cause problems in the future, e.g. when the deep insight of the code will be needed.
- **Total dedication.** The Agile process is more time-consuming as compared to the traditional approach because only active involvement of the team can lead to success. This means that developers must immerse themselves in the project and work long hours if necessary.
- **The result can differ from expectations.** The client may intend to get one product, but the final version will be completely different. This happens because of constant changes and the absence of an accurate plan and design.

### When to Use the Agile Methodology

The most suitable situations for using this methodology are when:

- The client needs quick results
- There is no clear vision of the final product
- Software is developed for a rapidly changing industry and constant improvements are needed
- Developers are skilled enough to make quick changes and be responsible for the entire process
