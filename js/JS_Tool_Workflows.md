## Module bundlers

### Webpack

https://webpack.js.org/concepts/

https://academind.com/learn/webpack/webpack-2-the-basics/

Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications â€” it takes all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser.

When Webpack processes your application, it builds a dependency graph which maps out the modules that your project needs and generates one or more **bundles**. A bundle is a distinct grouping of connected code that has been compiled and transformed for the browser.

If one file depends on another (it uses the code from a separate file), Webpack treats this as a dependency. Webpack also takes your non-code assets (images, fonts, styles, etc.) and converts them to dependencies for your application.

Loaders: compile files not JS

webpack.config.js: entry, output, module (rules => match files to loaders, plugins => a tap into the bundler life cycle, Dev Server =>  watch and serve files (auto recompile want have change))
