The **ref** is used to return a reference to the element. They can be useful when we need direct access to DOM element or an instance of a component.

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

In the typical React dataflow, [props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element.

There are a few good use cases for refs:

- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

## Don’t Overuse Refs

Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively.

For example, instead of exposing `open()` and `close()` methods on a `Dialog` component, pass an `isOpen` prop to it.

## Creating Refs

Refs are created using `React.createRef()` and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. Refs are commonly assigned to an instance property when a component is constructed so they can be referenced throughout the component.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;  }
}
```

### Accessing Refs

When a ref is passed to an element in `render`, a reference to the node becomes accessible at the `current` attribute of the ref.

```jsx
const node = this.myRef.current;
```

The value of the ref differs depending on the type of the node:

- When the `ref` attribute is used on an HTML element, the `ref` created in the constructor with `React.createRef()` receives the underlying DOM element as its `current` property.
- When the `ref` attribute is used on a custom class component, the `ref` object receives the mounted instance of the component as its `current`.
- **You may not use the `ref` attribute on function components** because they don’t have instances.



#### Adding a Ref to a DOM Element

This code uses a `ref` to store a reference to a DOM node:

```jsx
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
    this.focusTextInput = this.focusTextInput.bind(this);
  }

  focusTextInput() {
    // Explicitly focus the text input using the raw DOM API
    // Note: we're accessing "current" to get the DOM node
    this.textInput.current.focus();
    // this.textInput.focus();
  }

  render() {
    // tell React that we want to associate the <input> ref
    // with the `textInput` that we created in the constructor
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.textInput} />            
        <button
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}
        >Focus the text input</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React will assign the `current` property with the DOM element when the component mounts, and assign it back to `null` when it unmounts. `ref` updates happen before `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods.

#### Adding a Ref to a Class Component

If we wanted to wrap the `CustomTextInput` above to simulate it being clicked immediately after mounting, we could use a ref to get access to the custom input and call its `focusTextInput` method manually:

```jsx
class AutoFocusTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.textInput.current.focusTextInput();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput ref={this.textInput} />
    );
  }
}
```

Note that this only works if `CustomTextInput` is declared as a class

```jsx
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {  // ...
}
```

#### Refs and Function Components

By default, **you may not use the `ref` attribute on function components** because they don’t have instances:

```jsx
function MyFunctionComponent() {  return <input />;
}

class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();  }
  render() {
    // This will *not* work!
    return (
      <MyFunctionComponent ref={this.textInput} />    );
  }
}
```

If you want to allow people to take a `ref` to your function component, you can use [`forwardRef`](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) (possibly in conjunction with [`useImperativeHandle`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useimperativehandle)), or you can convert the component to a class.

You can, however, **use the `ref` attribute inside a function component** as long as you refer to a DOM element or a class component:

```javascript
function CustomTextInput(props) {
  // textInput must be declared here so the ref can refer to it
  let textInput = React.createRef();

  function handleClick() {
    textInput.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        ref={textInput} />
      <input
        type="button"
        value="Focus the text input"
        onClick={handleClick}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Exposing DOM Refs to Parent Components

In rare cases, you might want to have access to a child’s DOM node from a parent component. This is generally not recommended because it breaks component encapsulation, but it can occasionally be useful for triggering focus or measuring the size or position of a child DOM node.

While you could **add a ref to the child component**, this is not an ideal solution, as you would only get a component instance rather than a DOM node. Additionally, this wouldn’t work with function components.

**Ref forwarding lets components opt into exposing any child component’s ref as their own**. (React 16.3 or higher)

If you use React 16.2 or lower, or if you need more flexibility than provided by ref forwarding, you can use Callback Refs

https://gist.github.com/gaearon/1a018a023347fe1c2476073330cc5509

When possible, React advise against exposing DOM nodes, but it can be a useful escape hatch.

## Callback Refs

Instead of passing a `ref` attribute created by `createRef()`, you pass a function. The function receives the React component instance or HTML DOM element as its argument, which can be stored and accessed elsewhere.

```jsx
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.textInput = null;

    this.setTextInputRef = element => {
      this.textInput = element;
    };

    this.focusTextInput = () => {
      // Focus the text input using the raw DOM API
      if (this.textInput) this.textInput.focus();
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // autofocus the input on mount
    this.focusTextInput();
  }

  render() {
    // Use the `ref` callback to store a reference to the text input DOM
    // element in an instance field (for example, this.textInput).
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.setTextInputRef}
        />
        <input
          type="button"
          value="Focus the text input"
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React will call the `ref` callback with the DOM element when the component mounts, and call it with `null` when it unmounts. Refs are guaranteed to be up-to-date before `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` fires.

You can pass callback refs between components like you can with object refs that were created with `React.createRef()`.

```jsx
function CustomTextInput(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={props.inputRef} />    </div>
  );
}

class Parent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput
        inputRef={el => this.inputElement = el}      />
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, `Parent` passes its ref callback as an `inputRef` prop to the `CustomTextInput`, and the `CustomTextInput` passes the same function as a special `ref` attribute to the `<input>`. As a result, `this.inputElement` in `Parent` will be set to the DOM node corresponding to the `<input>` element in the `CustomTextInput`.

### Caveats with callback refs

If the `ref` callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with `null` and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one. You can avoid this by defining the `ref` callback as a bound method on the class, but note that it shouldn’t matter in most cases.

## Legacy API: String Refs

If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `"textInput"`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because string refs have [some issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8333#issuecomment-271648615), are considered legacy, and **are likely to be removed in one of the future releases**.

# Forwarding Refs

Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) through a component to one of its children.

However, it can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries.

https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html

## Forwarding refs to DOM components

```jsx
function FancyButton(props) {
  return (
    <button className="FancyButton">
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

React components hide their implementation details, including their rendered output. Other components using `FancyButton` **usually will not need to** [obtain a ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) to the inner `button` DOM element. This is good because it prevents components from relying on each other’s DOM structure too much.

Although such encapsulation is desirable for application-level components like `FeedStory` or `Comment`, it can be inconvenient for highly reusable “leaf” components like `FancyButton` or `MyTextInput`. These components tend to be used throughout the application in a similar manner as a regular DOM `button` and `input`, and accessing their DOM nodes may be unavoidable for managing focus, selection, or animations.

**Ref forwarding is an opt-in feature that lets some components take a `ref` they receive, and pass it further down (in other words, “forward” it) to a child.**

In the example below, `FancyButton` uses `React.forwardRef` to obtain the `ref` passed to it, and then forward it to the DOM `button` that it renders:

```jsx
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (  <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">    {props.children}
  </button>
));

// You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;
```

This way, components using `FancyButton` can get a ref to the underlying `button` DOM node and access it if necessary—just like if they used a DOM `button` directly.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in the above example:

1. We create a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) by calling `React.createRef` and assign it to a `ref` variable.
2. We pass our `ref` down to `<FancyButton ref={ref}>` by specifying it as a JSX attribute.
3. React passes the `ref` to the `(props, ref) => ...` function inside `forwardRef` as a second argument.
4. We forward this `ref` argument down to `<button ref={ref}>` by specifying it as a JSX attribute.
5. When the ref is attached, `ref.current` will point to the `<button>` DOM node.

> Note
>
> The second `ref` argument only exists when you define a component with `React.forwardRef` call. Regular function or class components don’t receive the `ref` argument, and ref is not available in props either.
>
> Ref forwarding is not limited to DOM components. You can forward refs to class component instances, too.

## Forwarding refs in higher-order components

This technique can also be particularly useful with [higher-order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (also known as HOCs). Let’s start with an example HOC that logs component props to the console:

```jsx
function logProps(WrappedComponent) {  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old props:', prevProps);
      console.log('new props:', this.props);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;    }
  }

  return LogProps;
}
```

The “logProps” HOC passes all `props` through to the component it wraps, so the rendered output will be the same. For example, we can use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component:

```jsx
class FancyButton extends React.Component {
  focus() {
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}

// Rather than exporting FancyButton, we export LogProps.
// It will render a FancyButton though.
export default logProps(FancyButton);
```

There is one caveat to the above example: refs will not get passed through. That’s because `ref` is not a prop. Like `key`, it’s handled differently by React. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component.

This means that refs intended for our `FancyButton` component will actually be attached to the `LogProps` component:

```jsx
import FancyButton from './FancyButton';

const ref = React.createRef();
// The FancyButton component we imported is the LogProps HOC.
// Even though the rendered output will be the same,
// Our ref will point to LogProps instead of the inner FancyButton component!
// This means we can't call e.g. ref.current.focus()
<FancyButton
  label="Click Me"
  handleClick={handleClick}
  ref={ref}/>;
```

Fortunately, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner `FancyButton` component using the `React.forwardRef` API. `React.forwardRef` accepts a render function that receives `props` and `ref` parameters and returns a React node. For example:

```jsx
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old props:', prevProps);
      console.log('new props:', this.props);
    }

    render() {
      const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;
      // Assign the custom prop "forwardedRef" as a ref
      return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;    }
  }

  // Note the second param "ref" provided by React.forwardRef.
  // We can pass it along to LogProps as a regular prop, e.g. "forwardedRef"
  // And it can then be attached to the Component.
  return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;  });}
```

## Displaying a custom name in DevTools

`React.forwardRef` accepts a render function. React DevTools uses this function to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component.

For example, the following component will appear as ”*ForwardRef*” in the DevTools:

```jsx
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
});
```

If you name the render function, DevTools will also include its name (e.g. ”*ForwardRef(myFunction)*”):

```jsx
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(
  function myFunction(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }
);
```

You can even set the function’s `displayName` property to include the component you’re wrapping:

```jsx
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    // ...
  }

  function forwardRef(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }

  // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools.
  // e.g. "ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))"
  const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;  forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;
  return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
}
```
