# [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)

https://router.vuejs.org/

https://router.vuejs.org/api/

It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze. Features include:

- Nested route/view mapping
- Modular, component-based router configuration
- Route params, query, wildcards
- View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system
- Fine-grained navigation control
- Links with automatic active CSS classes
- HTML5 history mode or hash mode, with auto-fallback in IE9
- Customizable Scroll Behavior

## Installation

## npm

```bash
npm install vue-router
```

When used with a module system, you must explicitly install the router via `Vue.use()`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

Vue.use(VueRouter)
```

## Vue CLI

If you have a project using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) you can add Vue Router as a plugin. You can let the CLI generate the code above for you as well as two sample routes. **It will also overwrite your `App.vue`** so make sure to backup the file before running the following command inside your project:

```sh
vue add router
```

#  Getting Started

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-router/dist/vue-router.js"></script>

<div id="app">
  <h1>Hello App!</h1>
  <p>
    <!-- use router-link component for navigation. -->
    <!-- specify the link by passing the `to` prop. -->
    <!-- `<router-link>` will be rendered as an `<a>` tag by default -->
    <router-link to="/foo">Go to Foo</router-link>
    <router-link to="/bar">Go to Bar</router-link>
  </p>
  <!-- route outlet -->
  <!-- component matched by the route will render here -->
  <router-view></router-view>
</div>
```

```js
// 0. If using a module system (e.g. via vue-cli), import Vue and VueRouter
// and then call `Vue.use(VueRouter)`.

// 1. Define route components.
// These can be imported from other files
const Foo = { template: '<div>foo</div>' }
const Bar = { template: '<div>bar</div>' }

// 2. Define some routes
// Each route should map to a component. The "component" can
// either be an actual component constructor created via
// `Vue.extend()`, or just a component options object.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.
const routes = [
  { path: '/foo', component: Foo },
  { path: '/bar', component: Bar }
]

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes // short for `routes: routes`
})

// 4. Create and mount the root instance.
// Make sure to inject the router with the router option to make the
// whole app router-aware.
const app = new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')

// Now the app has started!
```

By injecting the router, we get access to it as `this.$router` as well as the current route as `this.$route` inside of any component:

```js
// Home.vue
export default {
  computed: {
    username() {
      // We will see what `params` is shortly
      return this.$route.params.username
    }
  },
  methods: {
    goBack() {
      window.history.length > 1 ? this.$router.go(-1) : this.$router.push('/')
    }
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that `this.$router` is exactly the same as using `router`. The reason we use `this.$router` is because we don't want to import the router in every single component that needs to manipulate routing.

Notice that a `<router-link>` automatically gets the `.router-link-active` class when its target route is matched.

# Dynamic Route Matching

```js
const User = {
  template: '<div>User</div>'
}

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    // dynamic segments start with a colon
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User }
  ]
})
```

Now URLs like `/user/foo` and `/user/bar` will both map to the same route.

A dynamic segment is denoted by a colon `:`. When a route is matched, the value of the dynamic segments will be exposed as `this.$route.params`

```js
const User = {
  template: '<div>User {{ $route.params.id }}</div>'
}
```

In addition to `$route.params`, the `$route` object also exposes other useful information such as `$route.query` (if there is a query in the URL), `$route.hash`, etc.

## Reacting to Params Changes

One thing to note when using routes with params is that when the user navigates from `/user/foo` to `/user/bar`, **the same component instance will be reused**. Since both routes render the same component, this is more efficient than destroying the old instance and then creating a new one. **However, this also means that the lifecycle hooks of the component will not be called**.

To react to params changes in the same component, you can simply watch the `$route` object:

```js
const User = {
  template: '...',
  watch: {
    $route(to, from) {
      // react to route changes...
    }
  }
}
```

Or, use the `beforeRouteUpdate` [navigation guard](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html) introduced in 2.2:

```js
const User = {
  template: '...',
  beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) {
    // react to route changes...
    // don't forget to call next()
  }
}
```

## Catch all / 404 Not found Route

Regular params will only match characters in between url fragments, separated by `/`. If we want to match **anything**, we can use the asterisk (`*`):

```js
{
  // will match everything
  path: '*'
}
{
  // will match anything starting with `/user-`
  path: '/user-*'
}
```

When using *asterisk* routes, make sure to correctly order your routes so that *asterisk* ones are at the end. 

```js
// Given a route { path: '/user-*' }
this.$router.push('/user-admin')
this.$route.params.pathMatch // 'admin'

// Given a route { path: '*' }
this.$router.push('/non-existing')
this.$route.params.pathMatch // '/non-existing'
```

## Advanced Matching Patterns

https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/examples/route-matching/app.js

https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v1.7.0#parameters

`vue-router` uses  path-to-regexp as its path matching engine

## Matching Priority

Sometimes the same URL may be matched by multiple routes. In such a case the matching priority is determined by the order of route definition: the earlier a route is defined, the higher priority it gets.

# Nested Routes

```text
/user/foo/profile                     /user/foo/posts
+------------------+                  +-----------------+
| User             |                  | User            |
| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |
| | Profile      | |  +------------>  | | Posts       | |
| |              | |                  | |             | |
| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |
+------------------+                  +-----------------+
```

```vue
<div id="app">
  <router-view></router-view>
</div>
```

```js
const User = {
  template: `
    <div class="user">
      <h2>User {{ $route.params.id }}</h2>
      <router-view></router-view>
    </div>
  `
}

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User,
      children: [
        // UserHome will be rendered inside User's <router-view>
        // when /user/:id is matched
        { path: '', component: UserHome },
        {
          // UserProfile will be rendered inside User's <router-view>
          // when /user/:id/profile is matched
          path: 'profile',
          component: UserProfile
        },
        {
          // UserPosts will be rendered inside User's <router-view>
          // when /user/:id/posts is matched
          path: 'posts',
          component: UserPosts
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**Note that nested paths that start with `/` will be treated as a root path. This allows you to leverage the component nesting without having to use a nested URL.**

As you can see the `children` option is just another Array of route configuration objects like `routes` itself. Therefore, you can keep nesting views as much as you need.

# Programmatic Navigation

## `router.push(location, onComplete?, onAbort?)`

**Note: Inside of a Vue instance, you have access to the router instance as `$router`. You can therefore call `this.$router.push`.**

To navigate to a different URL, use `router.push`. This method pushes a new entry into the history stack, so when the user clicks the browser back button they will be taken to the previous URL.

This is the method called internally when you click a `<router-link>`, so clicking `<router-link :to="...">` is the equivalent of calling `router.push(...)`.

```js
// literal string path
router.push('home')

// object
router.push({ path: 'home' })

// named route
router.push({ name: 'user', params: { userId: '123' } })

// with query, resulting in /register?plan=private
router.push({ path: 'register', query: { plan: 'private' } })

// params are ignored if a path is provided, which is not the case for query
const userId = '123'
router.push({ name: 'user', params: { userId } }) // -> /user/123
router.push({ path: `/user/${userId}` }) // -> /user/123
// This will NOT work
router.push({ path: '/user', params: { userId } }) // -> /user
// The same rules apply for the to property of the router-link component.
```

**Note:** If the destination is the same as the current route and only params are changing (e.g. going from one profile to another `/users/1` -> `/users/2`), you will have to use [`beforeRouteUpdate`](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html#reacting-to-params-changes) to react to changes (e.g. fetching the user information).

## `router.replace(location, onComplete?, onAbort?)`

It acts like `router.push`, the only difference is that it navigates without pushing a new history entry, as its name suggests - it replaces the current entry.

 clicking `<router-link :to="..." replace>` is the equivalent of calling `router.replace(...)`.

## `router.go(n)`

This method takes a single integer as parameter that indicates by how many steps to go forwards or go backwards in the history stack, similar to `window.history.go(n)`.

```js
// go forward by one record, the same as history.forward()
router.go(1)

// go back by one record, the same as history.back()
router.go(-1)

// go forward by 3 records
router.go(3)

// fails silently if there aren't that many records.
router.go(-100)
router.go(100)
```

# Named Routes

Sometimes it is more convenient to identify a route with a name, especially when linking to a route or performing navigations. You can give a route a name in the `routes` options

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/user/:userId',
      name: 'user',
      component: User
    }
  ]
})
```

```html
<router-link :to="{ name: 'user', params: { userId: 123 }}">User</router-link>
```

```js
router.push({ name: 'user', params: { userId: 123 }})
```

# Named Views

Sometimes you need to display multiple views at the same time instead of nesting them, e.g. creating a layout with a `sidebar` view and a `main` view.

Instead of having one single outlet in your view, you can have multiple and give each of them a name. A `router-view` without a name will be given `default` as its name.

```html
<router-view class="view one"></router-view>
<router-view class="view two" name="a"></router-view>
<router-view class="view three" name="b"></router-view>
```

A view is rendered by using a component, therefore multiple views require multiple components for the same route. Make sure to use the `components` (with an s) option:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      components: {
        default: Foo,
        a: Bar,
        b: Baz
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

## Nested Named Views

https://jsfiddle.net/posva/22wgksa3/

```text
/settings/emails                                       /settings/profile
+-----------------------------------+                  +------------------------------+
| UserSettings                      |                  | UserSettings                 |
| +-----+-------------------------+ |                  | +-----+--------------------+ |
| | Nav | UserEmailsSubscriptions | |  +------------>  | | Nav | UserProfile        | |
| |     +-------------------------+ |                  | |     +--------------------+ |
| |     |                         | |                  | |     | UserProfilePreview | |
| +-----+-------------------------+ |                  | +-----+--------------------+ |
+-----------------------------------+                  +------------------------------+
```

- `Nav` is just a regular component
- `UserSettings` is the view component
- `UserEmailsSubscriptions`, `UserProfile`, `UserProfilePreview` are nested view components

```html
<!-- UserSettings.vue -->
<div>
  <h1>User Settings</h1>
  <NavBar/>
  <router-view/>
  <router-view name="helper"/>
</div>
```

```js
{
  path: '/settings',
  // You could also have named views at the top
  component: UserSettings,
  children: [{
    path: 'emails',
    component: UserEmailsSubscriptions
  }, {
    path: 'profile',
    components: {
      default: UserProfile,
      helper: UserProfilePreview
    }
  }]
}
```

#  Redirect and Alias

##  Redirect

https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/examples/redirect/app.js

Redirecting is also done in the `routes` configuration. To redirect from `/a` to `/b`:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/a', redirect: '/b' }
  ]
})
```

The redirect can also be targeting a named route:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/a', redirect: { name: 'foo' }}
  ]
})
```

Or even use a function for dynamic redirecting:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/a', redirect: to => {
      // the function receives the target route as the argument
      // return redirect path/location here.
    }}
  ]
})
```

## Alias

https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/examples/route-alias/app.js

A redirect means when the user visits `/a`, the URL will be replaced by `/b`, and then matched as `/b`. But what is an alias?

**An alias of `/a` as `/b` means when the user visits `/b`, the URL remains `/b`, but it will be matched as if the user is visiting `/a`.**

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/a', component: A, alias: '/b' }
  ]
})
```

An alias gives you the freedom to map a UI structure to an arbitrary URL, instead of being constrained by the configuration's nesting structure.

#  Passing Props to Route Components

**Instead of coupling to `$route`:**

```js
const User = {
  template: '<div>User {{ $route.params.id }}</div>'
}
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [{ path: '/user/:id', component: User }]
})
```

**Decouple it by using `props`**

```js
const User = {
  props: ['id'],
  template: '<div>User {{ id }}</div>'
}
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User, props: true },

    // for routes with named views, you have to define the `props` option for each named view:
    {
      path: '/user/:id',
      components: {
        default: User,
        sidebar: Sidebar
      },
      props: {
        default: true,
        // function mode, more about it below
        sidebar: route => ({ search: route.query.q })
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

This allows you to use the component anywhere, which makes the component easier to reuse and test.

## Boolean mode

When `props` is set to `true`, the `route.params` will be set as the component props.

## Object mode

When `props` is an object, this will be set as the component props as-is. Useful for when the props are static.

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/promotion/from-newsletter',
      component: Promotion,
      props: { newsletterPopup: false }
    }
  ]
})
```

## Function mode

You can create a function that returns props. This allows you to cast parameters into other types, combine static values with route-based values, etc.

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/search',
      component: SearchUser,
      props: route => ({ query: route.query.q })
    }
  ]
})
```

The URL `/search?q=vue` would pass `{query: 'vue'}` as props to the `SearchUser` component.

Try to keep the `props` function stateless, as it's only evaluated on route changes. Use a wrapper component if you need state to define the props, that way vue can react to state changes.
