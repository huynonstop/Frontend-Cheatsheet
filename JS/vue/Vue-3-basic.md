# Creating and connecting Vue app instances

https://v3.vuejs.org/api/application-api.html

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/instance.html#creating-an-application-instance

https://v3.vuejs.org/api/instance-methods.html

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({ /* options */ })
app.component('SearchInput', SearchInputComponent)
app.directive('focus', FocusDirective)
app.use(LocalePlugin)
//or
Vue.createApp({})
  .component('SearchInput', SearchInputComponent)
  .directive('focus', FocusDirective)
  .use(LocalePlugin)
```

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            message: "welcome to vue"
        }
    }
})

app.mount('#app')
```

## Root Component

The options passed to `createApp` are used to configure the **root component**. That component is used as the starting point for rendering when we **mount** the application.

Unlike most of the application methods, `mount` does not return the application. Instead it returns the root component instance.

Although not strictly associated with the MVVM pattern Vue's design was partly inspired by it. As a convention, we often use the variable `vm` (short for ViewModel) to refer to a component instance.

```js
const RootComponent = { /* options */ }
const app = Vue.createApp(RootComponent)
const vm = app.mount('#app')
```

Most real applications are organized into a tree of nested, reusable components. For example, a Todo application's component tree might look like this:

```text
Root Component
└─ TodoList
   ├─ TodoItem
   │  ├─ DeleteTodoButton
   │  └─ EditTodoButton
   └─ TodoListFooter
      ├─ ClearTodosButton
      └─ TodoListStatistics
```

Each component will have its own component instance, `vm`. For some components, such as `TodoItem`, there will likely be multiple instances rendered at any one time. All of the component instances in this application will share the same application instance.

## Component Instance Properties

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return { count: 4 }
  }
})

const vm = app.mount('#app')

console.log(vm.count) // => 4
```

There are various other component options that add user-defined properties to the component instance, such as `data`, `methods`, `props`, `computed`, `inject` and `setup`.  All of the properties of the component instance, no matter how they are defined, will be accessible in the component's template.

Vue also exposes some built-in properties via the component instance, such as `$attrs` and `$emit`. These properties all have a `$` prefix to avoid conflicting with user-defined property names.

## Lifecycle hooks

# Template Syntax

## Interpolation

 "Mustache" syntax (double curly braces)

```html
<div id="app">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
```

You can also perform one-time interpolations that do not update on data change by using the v-once directive, but keep in mind this will also affect any other bindings on the same node:

```html
<span v-once>This will never change: {{ msg }}</span>
```

### Raw html

```js
<p>Using mustaches: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>
```

![image-20201016194740903](assets/VueJs-3-basic/image-20201016194740903.png)

### Attributes

Mustaches cannot be used inside HTML attributes. Instead, use v-bind directive

```html
<div v-bind:id="dynamicId"></div>
<a v-bind:href="dynamicLink">some Link</a>
```

In the case of boolean attributes, where their mere existence implies `true`, `v-bind` works a little differently. In this example:

```html
<button v-bind:disabled="isButtonDisabled">Button</button>
```

If `isButtonDisabled` has the value of `null` or `undefined`, the `disabled` attribute will not even be included in the rendered `<button>` element.

### JavaScript Expressions

```html
{{ number + 1 }} {{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }} {{ message.split('').reverse().join('')}}

<div v-bind:id="'list-' + id"></div>
```

```js
const GLOBALS_WHITE_LISTED =
  'Infinity,undefined,NaN,isFinite,isNaN,parseFloat,parseInt,decodeURI,' +
  'decodeURIComponent,encodeURI,encodeURIComponent,Math,Number,Date,Array,' +
  'Object,Boolean,String,RegExp,Map,Set,JSON,Intl'
```

## Directives

https://v3.vuejs.org/api/directives.html

Directives are special attributes with the `v-` prefix. Directive attribute values are expected to be **a single JavaScript expression** (with the exception of `v-for` and `v-on`)

A directive's job is to reactively apply side effects to the DOM when the value of its expression changes

```html
<p v-if="seen">Now you see me</p>
```

Here, the `v-if` directive would remove/insert the `<p>` element based on the truthiness of the value of the expression `seen`.

### Argument

Some directives can take an "argument", denoted by a colon after the directive name. For example, the `v-bind` directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:

```html
<a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>
```

Here `href` is the argument, which tells the `v-bind` directive to bind the element's `href` attribute to the value of the expression `url`.

Another example is the `v-on` directive, which listens to DOM events:

```html
<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>
```

### Dynamic Arguments

```html
<a v-bind:[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>
```

Here `attributeName` will be dynamically evaluated as a JavaScript expression, and its evaluated value will be used as the final value for the argument. For example, if your component instance has a data property, `attributeName`, whose value is `"href"`, then this binding will be equivalent to `v-bind:href`.

Similarly, you can use dynamic arguments to bind a handler to a dynamic event name:

```html
<a v-on:[eventName]="doSomething"> ... </a>
```

In this example, when `eventName`'s value is `"focus"`, `v-on:[eventName]` will be equivalent to `v-on:focus`

#### warnings

Dynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a string, with the exception of `null`. The special value `null` can be used to explicitly remove the binding. Any other non-string value will trigger a warning

Dynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:

```html
<!-- This will trigger a compiler warning. -->
<a v-bind:['foo' + bar]="value"> ... </a>
```

We recommend replacing any complex expressions with a **computed property**

When using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase characters, as browsers will coerce attribute names into lowercase:

```html
<!--
This will be converted to v-bind:[someattr] in in-DOM templates.
Unless you have a "someattr" property in your instance, your code won't work.
-->
<a v-bind:[someAttr]="value"> ... </a>
```

### Modifiers

Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the `.prevent` modifier tells the `v-on` directive to call `event.preventDefault()` on the triggered event:

```html
<form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
```

## Shorthands

### v-bind

```html
<!-- full syntax -->
<a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a :href="url"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand with dynamic argument -->
<a :[key]="url"> ... </a>
```

### v-on

```html
<!-- full syntax -->
<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand -->
<a @click="doSomething"> ... </a>

<!-- shorthand with dynamic argument -->
<a @[event]="doSomething"> ... </a>
```

# Data Properties

The `data` option for a component is a function. Vue calls this function as part of creating a new component instance. It should return an object, which Vue will then wrap in its reactivity system and store on the component instance as `$data`. For convenience, any top-level properties of that object are also exposed directly via the component instance:

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return { count: 4 }
  }
})

const vm = app.mount('#app')
console.log(vm.$data.count) // => 4
console.log(vm.count)       // => 4

// Assigning a value to vm.count will also update $data.count
vm.count = 5
console.log(vm.$data.count) // => 5

// ... and vice-versa
vm.$data.count = 6
console.log(vm.count) // => 6
```

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

It is possible to add a new property directly to the component instance without including it in `data`. However, because this property isn't backed by the reactive `$data` object, it won't automatically be tracked by Vue's reactivity system

Vue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.

# Methods

To add methods to a component instance we use the `methods` option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return { count: 4 }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      // `this` will refer to the component instance
      // `this` inside methods points to the current active instance
      this.count++
    }
  }
})

const vm = app.mount('#app')

console.log(vm.count) // => 4

vm.increment()

console.log(vm.count) // => 5
```

Vue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value.

Just like all other properties of the component instance, the `methods` are accessible from within the component's template. Inside a template they are most commonly used as event listeners:

```html
<button @click="increment">Up vote</button>
```

It is also possible to call a method directly from a template. As we'll see shortly, it's usually better to use a computed property instead. However, you can call a method anywhere that a template supports JavaScript expressions:

```html
<span :title="toTitleDate(date)">
  {{ formatDate(date) }}
</span>
```

If the methods `toTitleDate` or `formatDate` access any reactive data then it will be tracked as a rendering dependency, just as if it had been used in the template directly.

Methods called from a template should not have any side effects, such as changing data or triggering asynchronous processes. If you find yourself tempted to do that you should probably use a lifecycle hook instead.

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/data-methods.html#debouncing-and-throttling

# Computed Properties

In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```html
<div id="computed-basics">
  <p>Has published books:</p>
  <span>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</span>
</div>
```

That's why for complex logic that includes reactive data, you should use a **computed property**

```html
<div id="computed-basics">
  <p>Has published books:</p>
  <span>{{ publishedBooksMessage }}</span>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    publishedBooksMessage() {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    }
  }
}).mount('#computed-basics')
```

You can data-bind to computed properties in templates just like a normal property. Vue is aware that `vm.publishedBooksMessage` depends on `vm.author.books`, so it will update any bindings that depend on `vm.publishedBooksMessage` when `vm.author.books` changes. And the best part is that we've created this dependency relationship declaratively: **the computed getter function has no side effects**

##  Computed Caching vs Methods

```html
<p>{{ calculateBooksMessage() }}</p>
```

```js
// in component
methods: {
  calculateBooksMessage() {
    return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
  }
}
```

Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. 

However, the difference is that **computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.** A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as `author.books` has not changed, multiple access to the `publishedBooksMessage` computed property will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the function again.

> Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property `list`, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on `list`. Without caching, we would be executing `list`’s getter many more times than necessary!

```js
computed: {
  now() {
      //This also means the following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive dependency
    return Date.now()
  }
}
```

In cases where you do not want caching, use a `method` instead.

A method invocation will **always** run the function whenever a re-render happens.

## Computed Setter

Computed properties are by default getter-only, but you can also provide a setter when you need it

```js
// ...
computed: {
  fullName: {
    // getter
    get() {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    },
    // setter
    set(newValue) {
      const names = newValue.split(' ')
      this.firstName = names[0]
      this.lastName = names[names.length - 1]
    }
  }
}
// ...
```

# Watchers

https://v3.vuejs.org/api/instance-methods.html#watch

While computed properties are more appropriate in most cases, there are times when a custom watcher is necessary. That's why Vue provides a more generic way to react to data changes through the `watch` option. This is most useful when you want to perform asynchronous or expensive operations in response to changing data

In this case, using the `watch` option allows us to perform an asynchronous operation (accessing an API) and sets a condition for performing this operation. None of that would be possible with a computed property.

In addition to the `watch` option, you can also use the imperative [vm.$watch API](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/instance-methods.html#watch)

```html
<div id="watch-example">
  <p>
    Ask a yes/no question:
    <input v-model="question" />
  </p>
  <p>{{ answer }}</p>
</div>
```

```html
<!-- Since there is already a rich ecosystem of ajax libraries    -->
<!-- and collections of general-purpose utility methods, Vue core -->
<!-- is able to remain small by not reinventing them. This also   -->
<!-- gives you the freedom to use what you're familiar with.      -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@0.12.0/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const watchExampleVM = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        question: '',
        answer: 'Questions usually contain a question mark. ;-)'
      }
    },
    watch: {
      // whenever question changes, this function will run
      question(newQuestion, oldQuestion) {
        if (newQuestion.indexOf('?') > -1) {
          this.getAnswer()
        }
      }
    },
    methods: {
      getAnswer() {
        this.answer = 'Thinking...'
        axios
          .get('https://yesno.wtf/api')
          .then(response => {
            this.answer = response.data.answer
          })
          .catch(error => {
            this.answer = 'Error! Could not reach the API. ' + error
          })
      }
    }
  }).mount('#watch-example')
</script>
```

# Computed vs Watched Property

Vue does provide a more generic way to observe and react to data changes on a current active instance: **watch properties**. When you have some data that needs to change based on some other data, it is tempting to overuse `watch`. However, it is often a better idea to use a computed property rather than an imperative `watch` callback

```html
<div id="demo">{{ fullName }}</div>
```

```js
const vm = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'Foo',
      lastName: 'Bar',
      fullName: 'Foo Bar'
    }
  },
  watch: {
    firstName(val) {
      this.fullName = val + ' ' + this.lastName
    },
    lastName(val) {
      this.fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + val
    }
  }
}).mount('#demo')
```

The above code is imperative and repetitive. Compare it with a computed property version:

```js
const vm = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'Foo',
      lastName: 'Bar'
    }
  },
  computed: {
    fullName() {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }
  }
}).mount('#demo')
```

# Dynamic styling

## HTML Classes

### Object syntax

```html
<div :class="{ active: isActive }"></div>
<div v-bind:class="{ active: isActive }"></div>

<!-- You can have multiple classes toggled by having more fields in the object -->
<div
  class="static" 
  :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"
></div>
<!-- You can have use class without binding and it's will be merged -->
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    isActive: true,
    hasError: false
  }
}
// => It will render: <div class="static active"></div>
// if hasError: true => It will render: <div class="static active text-danger"></div>
```

The above syntax means the presence of the `active` class will be determined by the [truthiness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) of the data property `isActive `and `hasError`.

You can bind class with a object:

```html
<div :class="classObject"></div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    classObject: {
      active: true,
      'text-danger': false
    }
  }
}
```

or computed property:

```html
<div :class="classObject"></div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    isActive: true,
    error: null
  }
},
computed: {
  classObject() {
    return {
      active: this.isActive && !this.error,
      'text-danger': this.error && this.error.type === 'fatal'
    }
  }
}
// => It will render: <div class="active text-danger"></div>
```

### Array syntax

We can pass an array to `:class` to apply a list of classes:

```html
<div :class="[activeClass, errorClass]"></div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    activeClass: 'active',
    errorClass: 'text-danger'
  }
}
```

If you would like to also toggle a class in the list conditionally, you can do it with a ternary expression:

```html
<div :class="[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]"></div>
```

This will always apply `errorClass`, but will only apply `activeClass` when `isActive` is truthy.

However, this can be a bit verbose if you have multiple conditional classes. That's why it's also possible to use the object syntax inside array syntax:

```html
<div :class="[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]"></div>
```

## Inline styling

### Object Syntax

The object syntax for `:style` is almost like CSS, except it's a JavaScript object. You can use either camelCase or kebab-case (use quotes with kebab-case) for the CSS property names

```html
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"></div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    activeColor: 'red',
    fontSize: 30
  }
}
```

```html
<div :style="styleObject"></div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    styleObject: {
      color: 'red',
      fontSize: '13px'
    }
  }
}
```

Again, the object syntax is often used in conjunction with computed properties that return objects.

###  Array Syntax

The array syntax for `:style` allows you to apply multiple style objects to the same element:

```html
<div :style="[baseStyles, overridingStyles]"></div>
```

### Auto-prefixing

When you use a CSS property that requires [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) in `:style`, for example `transform`, Vue will automatically detect and add appropriate prefixes to the applied styles.

### Multiple Values

You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:

```html
<div :style="{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }"></div>
```

This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render `display: flex` for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.

# Event handling

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/events.html#method-event-handlers

## Listening to Events

We can use the `v-on` directive, which we typically shorten to the `@` symbol, to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they're triggered

```html
<div id="basic-event">
  <button @click="counter += 1">Add 1</button>
  <p>The button above has been clicked {{ counter }} times.</p>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      counter: 1
    }
  }
}).mount('#basic-event')
```

## Method Event Handlers

```html
<div id="event-with-method">
  <button @click="greet">Greet</button>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      name: 'Vue.js'
    }
  },
  methods: {
    greet(event) {
      alert('Hello ' + this.name + '!')
      if (event) {
        alert(event.target.tagName)
      }
    }
  }
}).mount('#event-with-method')
```

## Methods in Inline Handlers

we can also use methods in an inline JavaScript statement

```html
<div id="inline-handler">
  <button @click="say('hi')">Say hi</button>
  <button @click="say('what')">Say what</button>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  methods: {
    say(message) {
      alert(message)
    }
  }
}).mount('#inline-handler')
```

Sometimes we also need to access the original DOM event in an inline statement handler. You can pass it into a method using the special `$event` variable:

```html
<button @click="warn('Form cannot be submitted yet.', $event)">
  Submit
</button>
```

```js
// ...
methods: {
  warn(message, event) {
    // now we have access to the native event
    if (event) {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
    alert(message)
  }
}
```

## Multiple Event Handlers

```html
<!-- both one() and two() will execute on button click -->
<button @click="one($event), two($event)">
  Submit
</button>
```

```js
// ...
methods: {
  one(event) {
    // first handler logic...
  },
  two(event) {
    // second handler logic...
  }
}
```

##  Event Modifiers

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/events.html#event-modifiers

It is a very common need to call `event.preventDefault()` or `event.stopPropagation()` inside event handlers. Although we can do this easily inside methods, it would be better if the methods can be purely about data logic rather than having to deal with DOM event details.

To address this problem, Vue provides **event modifiers** for `v-on`. Recall that modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.

- `.stop`
- `.prevent`
- `.capture`
- `.self`
- `.once`
- `.passive`

```html
<!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped -->
<a @click.stop="doThis"></a>

<!-- the submit event will no longer reload the page -->
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit"></form>

<!-- modifiers can be chained -->
<a @click.stop.prevent="doThat"></a>

<!-- just the modifier -->
<form @submit.prevent></form>

<!-- use capture mode when adding the event listener -->
<!-- i.e. an event targeting an inner element is handled here before being handled by that element -->
<div @click.capture="doThis">...</div>

<!-- only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself -->
<!-- i.e. not from a child element -->
<div @click.self="doThat">...</div>

<!-- the click event will be triggered at most once -->
<a @click.once="doThis"></a>

<!-- the scroll event's default behavior (scrolling) will happen -->
<!-- immediately, instead of waiting for `onScroll` to complete  -->
<!-- in case it contains `event.preventDefault()`                -->
<div @scroll.passive="onScroll">...</div>
```

> Order matters when using modifiers because the relevant code is generated in the same order. Therefore using `@click.prevent.self` will prevent **all clicks** while `@click.self.prevent` will only prevent clicks on the element itself.
>
> Don't use `.passive` and `.prevent` together, because `.prevent` will be ignored and your browser will probably show you a warning. Remember, `.passive` communicates to the browser that you *don't* want to prevent the event's default behavior.

## Key Modifiers

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/events.html#key-modifiers

When listening for keyboard events, we often need to check for specific keys. Vue allows adding key modifiers for `v-on` or `@` when listening for key events:

```html
<!-- only call `vm.submit()` when the `key` is `Enter` -->
<input @keyup.enter="submit" />
```

You can directly use any valid key names exposed via [`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) as modifiers by converting them to kebab-case.

```html
<input @keyup.page-down="onPageDown" />
```

In the above example, the handler will only be called if `$event.key` is equal to `'PageDown'`

### Key Aliases

Vue provides aliases for the most commonly used keys:

- `.enter`
- `.tab`
- `.delete` (captures both "Delete" and "Backspace" keys)
- `.esc`
- `.space`
- `.up`
- `.down`
- `.left`
- `.right`

## System Modifier Keys

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/events.html#system-modifier-keys

You can use the following modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners only when the corresponding modifier key is pressed:

- `.ctrl`
- `.alt`
- `.shift`
- `.meta`

```html
<!-- Alt + Enter -->
<input @keyup.alt.enter="clear" />

<!-- Ctrl + Click -->
<div @click.ctrl="doSomething">Do something</div>
```

### `.exact` Modifier

```html
<!-- this will fire even if Alt or Shift is also pressed -->
<button @click.ctrl="onClick">A</button>

<!-- this will only fire when Ctrl and no other keys are pressed -->
<button @click.ctrl.exact="onCtrlClick">A</button>

<!-- this will only fire when no system modifiers are pressed -->
<button @click.exact="onClick">A</button>
```

### Mouse Button Modifiers

- `.left`
- `.right`
- `.middle`

These modifiers restrict the handler to events triggered by a specific mouse button.

## Why Listeners in HTML?

You might be concerned that this whole event listening approach violates the good old rules about "separation of concerns". Rest assured - since all Vue handler functions and expressions are strictly bound to the ViewModel that's handling the current view, it won't cause any maintenance difficulty. In fact, there are several benefits in using `v-on` or `@`:

1. It's easier to locate the handler function implementations within your JS code by skimming the HTML template.
2. Since you don't have to manually attach event listeners in JS, your ViewModel code can be pure logic and DOM-free. This makes it easier to test.
3. When a ViewModel is destroyed, all event listeners are automatically removed. You don't need to worry about cleaning it up yourself.

# Data binding + Event handling = Two-way Binding

do it by hand

```html
<div id="two-way-binding">
   <input type="text" v-bind:value="name" v-on:input="setName" />
    <p>
        {{ name }}
    </p> 
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      name: ''
    }
  },
  methods: {
    setName(event) {
	  this.name = event.target.value;
    }
  }
}).mount('#two-way-binding')
```

##  Basic Usage

or use v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type. Although a bit magical, `v-model` is essentially syntax sugar for updating data on user input events, plus special care for some edge cases.

> `v-model` will ignore the initial `value`, `checked` or `selected` attributes found on any form elements. It will always treat the current active instance data as the source of truth. You should declare the initial value on the JavaScript side, inside the `data` option of your component.

`v-model` internally uses different properties and emits different events for different input elements:

- text and textarea elements use `value` property and `input` event;
- checkboxes and radiobuttons use `checked` property and `change` event;
- select fields use `value` as a prop and `change` as an event.

### Text

```html
<div id="two-way-binding">
   <input type="text" v-model="name" />
    <p>
        {{ name }}
    </p> 
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      name: ''
    }
  },
}).mount('#two-way-binding')
```

### Number

```vue
<div id="two-way-binding">
   <input type="number" v-model.number="age" />
    <p>
        {{ age }} 
    </p> 
</div>
<!-- this Vue will force the input data to a number -->
```

### Multiline text

```html
<span>Multiline message is:</span>
<p style="white-space: pre-line;">{{ message }}</p>
<textarea v-model="message" placeholder="add multiple lines"></textarea>
```

```html
<!-- bad -->
<textarea>{{ text }}</textarea>

<!-- good -->
<textarea v-model="text"></textarea>
```

### Checkbox

Single checkbox, boolean value:

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox" v-model="checked" />
<label for="checkbox">{{ checked }}</label>
```

Multiple checkboxes, bound to the same Array:

```html
<div id="v-model-multiple-checkboxes">
  <input type="checkbox" id="jack" value="Jack" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="jack">Jack</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="john" value="John" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="john">John</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="mike" value="Mike" v-model="checkedNames" />
  <label for="mike">Mike</label>
  <br />
  <span>Checked names: {{ checkedNames }}</span>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      checkedNames: []
    }
  }
}).mount('#v-model-multiple-checkboxes')
```

### Radio

```html
<div id="v-model-radiobutton">
  <input type="radio" id="one" value="One" v-model="picked" />
  <label for="one">One</label>
  <br />
  <input type="radio" id="two" value="Two" v-model="picked" />
  <label for="two">Two</label>
  <br />
  <span>Picked: {{ picked }}</span>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      picked: ''
    }
  }
}).mount('#v-model-radiobutton')
```

### Select

Single select:

```html
<div id="v-model-select" class="demo">
  <select v-model="selected">
    <option disabled value="">Please select one</option>
    <option>A</option>
    <option>B</option>
    <option>C</option>
  </select>
  <span>Selected: {{ selected }}</span>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      selected: ''
    }
  }
}).mount('#v-model-select')
```

> If the initial value of your `v-model` expression does not match any of the options, the `<select>` element will render in an "unselected" state. On iOS this will cause the user not being able to select the first item because iOS does not fire a change event in this case. It is therefore recommended to provide a disabled option with an empty value, as demonstrated in the example above.

Multiple select (bound to Array):

```html
<select v-model="selected" multiple>
  <option>A</option>
  <option>B</option>
  <option>C</option>
</select>
<br />
<span>Selected: {{ selected }}</span>
<!--Selected: ["A"] or Selected: ["A","B","C"] -->
```

Dynamic options rendered with `v-for`:

```html
<div id="v-model-select-dynamic" class="demo">
  <select v-model="selected">
    <option v-for="option in options" :value="option.value">
      {{ option.text }}
    </option>
  </select>
  <span>Selected: {{ selected }}</span>
</div>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      selected: 'A',
      options: [
        { text: 'One', value: 'A' },
        { text: 'Two', value: 'B' },
        { text: 'Three', value: 'C' }
      ]
    }
  }
}).mount('#v-model-select-dynamic')
```

##  Value Bindings

For radio, checkbox and select options, the `v-model` binding values are usually static strings (or booleans for checkbox):

```html
<!-- `picked` is a string "a" when checked -->
<input type="radio" v-model="picked" value="a" />

<!-- `toggle` is either true or false -->
<input type="checkbox" v-model="toggle" />

<!-- `selected` is a string "abc" when the first option is selected -->
<select v-model="selected">
  <option value="abc">ABC</option>
</select>
```

But sometimes we may want to bind the value to a dynamic property on the current active instance. We can use `v-bind` to achieve that. In addition, using `v-bind` allows us to bind the input value to non-string values

### Checkbox

```html
<input type="checkbox" v-model="toggle" true-value="yes" false-value="no" />
```

```js
// when checked:
vm.toggle === 'yes'
// when unchecked:
vm.toggle === 'no'
```

> The `true-value` and `false-value` attributes don't affect the input's `value` attribute, because browsers don't include unchecked boxes in form submissions. To guarantee that one of two values is submitted in a form (e.g. "yes" or "no"), use radio inputs instead.

### Radio

```html
<input type="radio" v-model="pick" v-bind:value="a" />
```

```js
// when checked:
vm.pick === vm.a
```

### Select Options

```html
<select v-model="selected">
  <!-- inline object literal -->
  <option :value="{ number: 123 }">123</option>
</select>
```

```js
// when selected:
typeof vm.selected // => 'object'
vm.selected.number // => 123
```

## Modifiers

`.lazy`

By default, `v-model` syncs the input with the data after each `input` event. You can add the `lazy` modifier to instead sync after `change` events:

```html
<!-- synced after "change" instead of "input" -->
<input v-model.lazy="msg" />
```

`.number`

If you want user input to be automatically typecast as a number, you can add the `number` modifier to your `v-model` managed inputs:

```html
<input v-model.number="age" type="number" />
```

This is often useful, because even with `type="number"`, the value of HTML input elements always returns a string. If the value cannot be parsed with `parseFloat()`, then the original value is returned.

`.trim`

If you want whitespace from user input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the `trim` modifier to your `v-model`-managed inputs:

```html
<input v-model.trim="msg" />
```

# Template refs

Despite the existence of props and events, sometimes you might still need to directly access a child component in JavaScript. To achieve this you can assign a reference ID to the child component or HTML element using the `ref` attribute.

```js
const app = Vue.createApp({})

app.component('base-input', {
  template: `
    <input ref="input" />
  `,
  methods: {
    focusInput() {
      this.$refs.input.focus()
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    this.focusInput()
  }
})
```

Also, you can add another `ref` to the component itself and use it to trigger `focusInput` event from the parent component:

```html
<base-input ref="usernameInput"></base-input>
```

```js
this.$refs.usernameInput.focusInput()
```

`$refs` are only populated after the component has been rendered. It is only meant as an escape hatch for direct child manipulation - you should avoid accessing `$refs` from within templates or computed properties.

# Conditional Rendering

## `v-if`

The directive `v-if` is used to conditionally render a block. The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns a truthy value.

```html
<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
```

Conditional Groups with `v-if` on `<template>`

Because `v-if` is a directive, it has to be attached to a single element. We can use `v-if` on a `<template>` element, which serves as an invisible wrapper. The final rendered result will not include the `<template>` element

```html
<template v-if="ok">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</template>
```

## `v-else`

You can use the `v-else` directive to indicate an "else block" for `v-if`:

```html
<div v-if="Math.random() > 0.5">
  Now you see me
</div>
<div v-else>
  Now you don't
</div>
```

A `v-else` element must immediately follow a `v-if` or a `v-else-if` element - otherwise it will not be recognized.

## `v-else-if`

The `v-else-if`, as the name suggests, serves as an "else if block" for `v-if`. It can also be chained multiple times:

```html
<div v-if="type === 'A'">
  A
</div>
<div v-else-if="type === 'B'">
  B
</div>
<div v-else-if="type === 'C'">
  C
</div>
<div v-else>
  Not A/B/C
</div>
```

Similar to `v-else`, a `v-else-if` element must immediately follow a `v-if` or a `v-else-if` element.

## `v-show`

Another option for conditionally displaying an element is the `v-show` directive. The usage is largely the same:

```html
<h1 v-show="ok">Hello!</h1>
```

The difference is that an element with `v-show` will always be rendered and remain in the DOM; `v-show` only toggles the `display` CSS property of the element.

`v-show` doesn't support the `<template>` element, nor does it work with `v-else`.

## `v-if` vs `v-show`

`v-if` is "real" conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly **destroyed and re-created during toggles**.

`v-if` is also **lazy**: if the condition is false on initial render, it will not do anything - the conditional block won't be rendered until the condition becomes true for the first time.

In comparison, `v-show` is much simpler - the element is always rendered regardless of initial condition, with **CSS-based toggling**.

Generally speaking, `v-if` has higher toggle costs while `v-show` has higher initial render costs. So prefer `v-show` if you need to toggle something very often, and prefer `v-if` if the condition is unlikely to change at runtime.

# List Rendering

## `v-for`

We can use the `v-for` directive to render a list of items based on an array. The `v-for` directive requires a special syntax in the form of `item in items`, where `items` is the source data array and `item` is an **alias** for the array element being iterated on:

```html
<ul id="array-rendering">
  <li v-for="item in items">
    {{ item.message }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      items: [{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }]
    }
  }
}).mount('#array-rendering')
```

Inside `v-for` blocks we have full access to parent scope properties. `v-for` also supports an optional second argument for the index of the current item.

```html
<ul id="array-with-index">
  <li v-for="(item, index) in items">
    {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      parentMessage: 'Parent',
      items: [{ message: 'Foo' }, { message: 'Bar' }]
    }
  }
}).mount('#array-with-index')
```

You can also use `of` as the delimiter instead of `in`

```html
<div v-for="item of items"></div>
```

`v-for` can also take an **integer**. In this case it will repeat the template that many times.

```html
<div id="range" class="demo">
  <span v-for="n in 10">{{ n }} </span>
</div>
```

you can also use a **`<template>` tag** with `v-for` to render a block of multiple elements. For example:

```html
<ul>
  <template v-for="item in items">
    <li>{{ item.msg }}</li>
    <li class="divider" role="presentation"></li>
  </template>
</ul>
```

## `v-for` with an Object

```html
<ul id="v-for-object" class="demo">
  <li v-for="value in myObject">
    {{ value }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      myObject: {
        title: 'How to do lists in Vue',
        author: 'Jane Doe',
        publishedAt: '2016-04-10'
      }
    }
  }
}).mount('#v-for-object')
```

```html
<li v-for="(value, key) in myObject">
  {{ key }}: {{ value }}
</li>
```

```html
<li v-for="(value, name, index) in myObject">
  {{ index }}. {{ name }}: {{ value }}
</li>
```

## Maintaining State (key)

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/list.html#maintaining-state

https://v3.vuejs.org/api/special-attributes.html#key

> When Vue is updating a list of elements rendered with `v-for`, by default it uses an "in-place patch" strategy. If the order of the data items has changed, instead of moving the DOM elements to match the order of the items, Vue will patch each element in-place and make sure it reflects what should be rendered at that particular index.
>
> This default mode is efficient, but **only suitable when your list render output does not rely on child component state or temporary DOM state (e.g. form input values)**.

To give Vue a hint so that it can track each node's identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique `key` attribute for each item:

```html
<div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

It is recommended to provide a `key` attribute with `v-for` whenever possible, unless the iterated DOM content is simple, or you are intentionally relying on the default behavior for performance gains.

## Array Change Detection

### Mutation Methods

Vue wraps an observed array's mutation methods so they will also trigger view updates. The wrapped methods are:

- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `shift()`
- `unshift()`
- `splice()`
- `sort()`
- `reverse()`

### Non-mutating methods

e.g. `filter()`, `concat()` and `slice()`, which do not mutate the original array but **always return a new array**

You might think this will cause Vue to throw away the existing DOM and re-render the entire list - luckily, that is not the case. Vue implements some smart heuristics to maximize DOM element reuse, so replacing an array with another array containing overlapping objects is a very efficient operation.

## Displaying Filtered/Sorted Results

In this case, you can create a computed property that returns the filtered or sorted array.

For example:

```html
<li v-for="n in evenNumbers">{{ n }}</li>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    numbers: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  }
},
computed: {
  evenNumbers() {
    return this.numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0)
  }
}
```

In situations where computed properties are not feasible (e.g. inside nested `v-for` loops), you can use a method:

```html
<ul v-for="numbers in sets">
  <li v-for="n in even(numbers)">{{ n }}</li>
</ul>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    sets: [[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
  }
},
methods: {
  even(numbers) {
    return numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0)
  }
}
```

## `v-for` with `v-if`

https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/list.html#v-for-with-v-if

https://v3.vuejs.org/style-guide/#avoid-v-if-with-v-for-essential

Using `v-if` and `v-for` together is **not recommended**.

When they exist on the same node, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`. That means the `v-if` condition will not have access to variables from the scope of the `v-for`:

```html
<!-- This will throw an error because property "todo" is not defined on instance. -->

<li v-for="todo in todos" v-if="!todo.isComplete">
  {{ todo }}
</li>
```

This can be fixed by moving `v-for` to a wrapping `<template>` tag:

```html
<template v-for="todo in todos">
  <li v-if="!todo.isComplete">
    {{ todo }}
  </li>
</template>
```

or filter before using v-for

```html
<li v-for="todo in completedTodos">
  {{ todo }}
</li>
```
